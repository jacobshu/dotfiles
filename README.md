# dotfiles

A repository to host various configuration files for future use. 

## Process

This is in flux currently. The target system will be to have a properly versioned Rust CLI that can be downloaded and contains all the code necessary to bootstrap a system.


## Templating 

This repository is indebted to a number of resources including:
- [Rosco Kalis's dotfiles](https://github.com/rkalis/dotfiles) covered in [this blog post](https://kalis.me/dotfiles-automating-macos-system-configuration/).
